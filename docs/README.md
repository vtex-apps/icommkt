# APP NAME

Under the app's name, you should explain the topic, giving a **brief description** of the **app's functionality** (what is it for?) in a store.

Next, you can **add media** (either an image of a GIF) if possible, so that users can better understand how the app works in practice. 

![Media Placeholder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52087100/71204177-42ca4f80-227e-11ea-89e6-e92e65370c69.png)

## Configuration

In this section, you first must **add the primary instructions** that will allow users to use the app in their store, such as [installing the app](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/store/installing-an-app) and configuring it using the account's admin. 

Remember to also **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the app in this section, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration. 

## Modus Operandi *(not mandatory)*

There are scenarios in which an app can behave differently in a store, according to its configuration. It's crucial then to go through these **behavioral changes** in this section, allowing users to fully understand the **practical application** of the app in their store.

If you feel compelled to give further details, such as the app's **relationship with others**, don't hesitate to use this section.
